## Speech Synthesis

SpeechNinja is powered by [TTSReader's Engine](https://ttsreader.com/), which is in its turn powered by the `Web Speech API`.


## Hosting

Hosted by github pages. Github project repository is here https://github.com/ttsreader/speechninja


## App technology

The app itself is built on JavaScript, using npm. The code behind it is not open source.

## Site technology

The website around the app, landing page, docs, etc. is based on [Doks](https://doks.netlify.app) which is an amazing open source Hugo theme. We found Doks to be simply a piece of art. Doks is powered by Hugo & npm in a great hybrid that brings a lot of power, beauty and efficiency to this template / Hugo theme.
