## Detailed Instructions

### Pre-operation:

- Connect a high-quality microphone to your PC (if you have a built-in microphone it might be good enough).

### Operation:

1) Click the mic
2) For the first time only: Your browser will popup a request for you to allow the site to listen to your mic. Click "Allow".
3) Start dictating. Speak slowly and clearly. Space your words and emphasize correct diction for better results.
4) Intermediate results will show in the buffer. There are 3 ways to finalize and shift transcription results from the buffer to the text editor itself:

   * Press "Enter" key on the keyboard
   * Say or click on a punctuation mark
   * Wait

<br/>

## Troubleshooting:

Most common causes for failures are:
1) Hardware problem with the microphone
2) Browser not Chrome or Edge
3) Permission to listen not granted
4) Chrome listens to the wrong microphone

To fix the last 2 problems, you should click on the small camera icon in the browser's address bar (will appear after you click the mic) and there set the permission to Allow speechnotes and pick the correct microphone from the drop-down list.

## Who can benefit from Speechnotes?

Anyone who is tired of ordinary key-typing might find Speechnotes useful. It might also be helpful specifically for people with difficulties in typing. Such difficulties could be of a result of physical condition, or simply not mastering the keyboard typing technique in an early enough age.
In addition, people who type a lot as their profession or hobby might find Speechnotes very useful as long keyboard typing might be very tyring, and even have medical implications as side effects. Needless to say, transcribers (from students to professionals) will find Speechnotes super helpful, as they can listen to a recording and repeat the speech into the mic, to get Speechnotes to transcribe it for them.

## Features Built to Increase Productivity & Efficiency for both Voice Typing & Regular Key Typing

For many of us, key-typing is slow and thus time-consuming. Speechnotes lets you type at the speed of speech (slow & clear speech).

* Speechnotes lets you move from voice-typing (dictation) to key-typing seamlessly. This way, you can dictate when convenient and type when more appropriate. You can also dictate and edit your text results right away, and continue dictating. No need to go through app modes or even stop dictation.
* Insert punctuation marks by speech (voice commands) or by a single click.
* Auto save that saves the document in real time upon any change, so you don't ever have to disturb yourself with it.
* Export to Google Drive (cloud saving) or download as a document to your computer.
* One click to email, or print your note.
* Automatic smart capitalization of letters at the beginning of sentences.
* No Login, registration, installation, or download needed. Works "right out of the box". So, where are all the automatically saved notes stored? Speechnotes stores all your data on your own computer, through your browser. The advantage is that you don't have to sign in. The disadvantage is that you cannot access these documents from other computers. For that - Speechnotes lets you export to Google Drive. Another small disadvantage is that after many many notes, you might run out of storage room, so, it's a good practice to delete from time-to-time unnecessary older notes.
* Unlimited usage.
* Accuracy - accuracy levels higher than 90% should be expected.
* Multilingual
