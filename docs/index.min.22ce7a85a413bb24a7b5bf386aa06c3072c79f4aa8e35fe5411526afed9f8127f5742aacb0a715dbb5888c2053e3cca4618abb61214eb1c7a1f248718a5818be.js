Operation: # Click the mic
For the first time only: Your browser will popup a request for you to allow the site to listen to your mic. Click \u0026ldquo;Allow\u0026rdquo;.
Start dictating. Speak slowly and clearly. Space your words and emphasize correct diction for better results.
Intermediate results will show in the buffer. There are 3 ways to finalize and shift transcription results from the buffer to the text editor itself:
Press \u0026ldquo;Enter\u0026rdquo; key on the keyboard Say or click on a punctuation mark Wait Troubleshooting: # Most common causes for failures are:
Hardware problem with the microphone Browser not Chrome or Edge Permission to listen not granted Chrome listens to the wrong microphone To fix the last 2 problems, you should click on the small camera icon in the browser\u0026rsquo;s address bar (will appear after you click the mic) and there set the permission to Allow speechnotes and pick the correct microphone from the drop-down list.
Who can benefit from Speechnotes? # Anyone who is tired of ordinary key-typing might find Speechnotes useful. It might also be helpful specifically for people with difficulties in typing. Such difficulties could be of a result of physical condition, or simply not mastering the keyboard typing technique in an early enough age. In addition, people who type a lot as their profession or hobby might find Speechnotes very useful as long keyboard typing might be very tyring, and even have medical implications as side effects. Needless to say, transcribers (from students to professionals) will find Speechnotes super helpful, as they can listen to a recording and repeat the speech into the mic, to get Speechnotes to transcribe it for them.
Compatibility \u0026amp; System Requirements # Chrome or Edge browser. No need for installation, disk space or high-end machines. It will run smoothly on your PC, desktop, laptop and Chromebook. You might try it on your tablets and phones, but it might have issues with some devices. We also have an Android app, and a sister iOS app (TextHear.com)
Features Built to Increase Productivity \u0026amp; Efficiency for both Voice Typing \u0026amp; Regular Key Typing # For many of us, key-typing is slow and thus time-consuming. Speechnotes lets you type at the speed of speech (slow \u0026amp; clear speech).
Speechnotes lets you move from voice-typing (dictation) to key-typing seamlessly. This way, you can dictate when convenient and type when more appropriate. You can also dictate and edit your text results right away, and continue dictating. No need to go through app modes or even stop dictation. Insert punctuation marks by speech (voice commands) or by a single click. Auto save that saves the document in real time upon any change, so you don\u0026rsquo;t ever have to disturb yourself with it. Export to Google Drive (cloud saving) or download as a document to your computer. One click to email, or print your note. Automatic smart capitalization of letters at the beginning of sentences. No Login, registration, installation, or download needed. Works \u0026ldquo;right out of the box\u0026rdquo;. So, where are all the automatically saved notes stored? Speechnotes stores all your data on your own computer, through your browser. The advantage is that you don\u0026rsquo;t have to sign in. The disadvantage is that you cannot access these documents from other computers. For that - Speechnotes lets you export to Google Drive. Another small disadvantage is that after many many notes, you might run out of storage room, so, it\u0026rsquo;s a good practice to delete from time-to-time unnecessary older notes. Unlimited usage. Accuracy - accuracy levels higher than 90% should be expected.

Once purchased, you will see you credit-minutes added and updated on the main screen. It may take a few seconds for the payment and update to go through. Please note: for your convenience, we accept payments both from PayPal and from credit cards, whatever you choose. Payments are secured and processed by PayPal. Upload file, or link url # Then - last step - simply upload your file. Speechnotes-Files accepts most types of both audio and video files. Although, for your own convenience it is much preferable to upload audio files and not videos as videos are much larger in size. Which means uploading a video file may take much more time and data (if you are on mobile) than uploading only the audio part. So, if upload of a video file is too slow, or fails altogether due to interrupts, it is recommended to extract the audio out of the video and upload the audio part alone. Upload button Then, the upload dialog will open, where you can select your file, select the language of the audio in the recording and type if necessary. Upload dialog For your convenience, you can either upload a file stored on your local disk, or - you can simply paste the url to a file online or even a regular YouTube link. The url can be a direct url to an audio or video file, YouTube, or a Google Drive url. If your files are already on Google Drive - then this is the preferred option. Please note that Google-Drive links are limited to 100MB file size. Please note: if you select to pass a Google Drive url - please make sure the file is less than 100MB and that it is indeed publicly shared and accessible through that link, as we do not ask for a specific permission to access it. Here's how to get a public url for a file on Drive Upload multiple files at once # For your convenience, you can even upload multiple files at once, or send multiple links at once. If you do send multiple links, please separate them with a comma.
