The Speechnotes Team `}),e.add({id:5,href:"/blog/speechnotes-vs-rev-live-test/",title:"Speechnotes VS Rev - Live Test",description:"We compared Speechnotes to Rev's transcription service. Performance, price, speed and more.",content:`The Big AI Transcription Battle: Speechnotes vs. Rev # Welcome to the big AI Transcription Battle! Automatic transcription is evolving as novel AI models bring transcription accuracy to near-human or even better-than-human levels. Along with big benefits in pricing, speed (real-time results), and privacy (no one is listening to your recordings), the competition is fierce.
We decided to do a head-to-head battle between two leading AI transcription service providers: Speechnotes \u0026amp; Rev. We\u0026rsquo;ll compare them on Accuracy, Speed, Price, Privacy, Ease of Use, and Translation Options.
For a fair comparison, we used the exact same YouTube video for both services. The video featured a home-style recording of a conversation, providing a mix of clear and challenging audio elements.
Watch the Video # Let’s Dive In! # We split the screen so you can see how the entire transcription process works on both sites, and we\u0026rsquo;ll use a timer to track the time it takes from uploading the file to receiving the results.
Uploading Process # Both Speechnotes and Rev allow you to upload files or use links to online recordings. For our test, we pasted the link to the YouTube video on both platforms. Then, we selected the language and the number of speakers before starting the upload.
On Rev, there is an extra step for payment. On Speechnotes, you can purchase pre-paid minutes, which are saved in your account. This means you don’t need to go through the payment process for each upload task, making the workflow smoother. Speechnotes gets a point for ease-of-use here. Additionally, Speechnotes allows you to upload multiple files at once, which is super convenient if you have more than one file to transcribe. So, Speechnotes scores another point for ease-of-use.
Furthermore, Speechnotes shows the stage of the transcription process in real time, while on Rev, you have to refresh the page to see progress. Speechnotes earns one more point for this.
Pricing # Speechnotes: 10 cents per minute Rev: 25 cents per minute Speechnotes wins the pricing category by offering transcription services at less than half the price of Rev.
Speed # Speechnotes completed the task in approximately a minute and a half. Rev took more than 3 minutes to finish the same task. Speechnotes clearly wins the speed category, delivering results twice as fast as Rev.
Accuracy # Both services provided excellent results. While Speechnotes may have been slightly more accurate in a few words, the difference was minor. It\u0026rsquo;s fair to conclude that both services achieved the same high level of accuracy.
Privacy # Privacy is crucial, and both services declare similar high standards of privacy for their AI transcription services. We consider both Speechnotes and Rev equal in this category.
Translation Options # Here’s where Speechnotes really shines. Speechnotes is a world pioneer, offering instant automatic translations to any language (or multiple languages) from the transcription results you receive. Rev does not offer this feature at all.
Conclusion: The Ultimate Winner # The ultimate winner of our transcription battle is\u0026hellip; Speechnotes — hands down!
Half the price Twice as fast Ease of use Accurate performance Instant translation options Speechnotes is the top choice for your transcription needs. Try it out for free today and experience the difference for yourself!

When to use human transcription? # Use human transcription when:
You need a very high accuracy, and you are willing to pay for it. The accuracy of human transcription is usually 99% and above, while the accuracy of automatic transcription is usually 90% and above - and depends greatly on audio quality, language \u0026amp; accent. When audio quality is not great, or accent is heavy, or - you tried automatic transcription - and results were not good enough. When NOT to use human transcription? # NEVER use human transcription when privacy is important!! If you do not care about the audio being leaked - go ahead. But - if you are NOT willing to have the recording leaked - never use human transcription online. In that case - we recommend using Speechnotes\u0026rsquo; Automatic Transcription Service.
The reason is that online transcription services are usually done by freelancers, and you have no control over who they are, and what they do with your audio. Your audio passes a few hands, a few devices, and there are many opportunities to leak it. So - if you care about privacy - never use human transcription online.
Contrary to that - Speechnotes\u0026rsquo; Automatic Transcription Service is 100% private. No human is involved. All audio is removed as soon as the job is done. Only you have secure access to the results, and when you choose to delete the results after you receive it - it is gone forever from our database.

Operation: # Click the mic
For the first time only: Your browser will popup a request for you to allow the site to listen to your mic. Click \u0026ldquo;Allow\u0026rdquo;.
Start dictating. Speak slowly and clearly. Space your words and emphasize correct diction for better results.
Intermediate results will show in the buffer. There are 3 ways to finalize and shift transcription results from the buffer to the text editor itself:
Press \u0026ldquo;Enter\u0026rdquo; key on the keyboard Say or click on a punctuation mark Wait Troubleshooting: # Most common causes for failures are:
Hardware problem with the microphone Browser not Chrome or Edge Permission to listen not granted Chrome listens to the wrong microphone To fix the last 2 problems, you should click on the small camera icon in the browser\u0026rsquo;s address bar (will appear after you click the mic) and there set the permission to Allow speechnotes and pick the correct microphone from the drop-down list.
Who can benefit from Speechnotes? # Anyone who is tired of ordinary key-typing might find Speechnotes useful. It might also be helpful specifically for people with difficulties in typing. Such difficulties could be of a result of physical condition, or simply not mastering the keyboard typing technique in an early enough age. In addition, people who type a lot as their profession or hobby might find Speechnotes very useful as long keyboard typing might be very tyring, and even have medical implications as side effects. Needless to say, transcribers (from students to professionals) will find Speechnotes super helpful, as they can listen to a recording and repeat the speech into the mic, to get Speechnotes to transcribe it for them.
Compatibility \u0026amp; System Requirements # Chrome or Edge browser. No need for installation, disk space or high-end machines. It will run smoothly on your PC, desktop, laptop and Chromebook. You might try it on your tablets and phones, but it might have issues with some devices. We also have an Android app, and a sister iOS app (TextHear.com)
Features Built to Increase Productivity \u0026amp; Efficiency for both Voice Typing \u0026amp; Regular Key Typing # For many of us, key-typing is slow and thus time-consuming. Speechnotes lets you type at the speed of speech (slow \u0026amp; clear speech).
Speechnotes lets you move from voice-typing (dictation) to key-typing seamlessly. This way, you can dictate when convenient and type when more appropriate. You can also dictate and edit your text results right away, and continue dictating. No need to go through app modes or even stop dictation. Insert punctuation marks by speech (voice commands) or by a single click. Auto save that saves the document in real time upon any change, so you don\u0026rsquo;t ever have to disturb yourself with it. Export to Google Drive (cloud saving) or download as a document to your computer. One click to email, or print your note. Automatic smart capitalization of letters at the beginning of sentences. No Login, registration, installation, or download needed. Works \u0026ldquo;right out of the box\u0026rdquo;. So, where are all the automatically saved notes stored? Speechnotes stores all your data on your own computer, through your browser. The advantage is that you don\u0026rsquo;t have to sign in. The disadvantage is that you cannot access these documents from other computers. For that - Speechnotes lets you export to Google Drive. Another small disadvantage is that after many many notes, you might run out of storage room, so, it\u0026rsquo;s a good practice to delete from time-to-time unnecessary older notes. Unlimited usage.

Upload file, or link url # Then - last step - simply upload your file. Speechnotes-Files accepts most types of both audio and video files. Although, for your own convenience it is much preferable to upload audio files and not videos as videos are much larger in size. Which means uploading a video file may take much more time and data (if you are on mobile) than uploading only the audio part. So, if upload of a video file is too slow, or fails altogether due to interrupts, it is recommended to extract the audio out of the video and upload the audio part alone. Upload button Then, the upload dialog will open, where you can select your file, select the language of the audio in the recording and type if necessary. Upload dialog For your convenience, you can either upload a file stored on your local disk, or - you can simply paste the url to a file online or even a regular YouTube link. The url can be a direct url to an audio or video file, YouTube, or a Google Drive url. If your files are already on Google Drive - then this is the preferred option. Please note that Google-Drive links are limited to 100MB file size. Please note: if you select to pass a Google Drive url - please make sure the file is less than 100MB and that it is indeed publicly shared and accessible through that link, as we do not ask for a specific permission to access it.
