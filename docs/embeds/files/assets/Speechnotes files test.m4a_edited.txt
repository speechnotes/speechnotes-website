Hi, I'm Ronen. I'm one of the developers of speechnotes. This recording was taken outside to test speechnotes files.
 It was taken on my smartphone and outside and I have a foriegn accent. So it should be quite difficult for any automatic transcription to do a good job. I hope speechnotes files can handle it.
 The audio file was also compressed.
 So it's really like any standard recording you would do on your smartphone.
 Please note speechnotes files also auto punctuates your files and adds timestamps to
 every few sentences, so you can sync between the audio recording and the text you received from us.
 I hope you like it and I hope you get good results with us. 

And we'd love to hear from you our email is admin@speechlogger.com. 
Feel free to contact us. Bye bye.
